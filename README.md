# Qill Me

**Qill Me** is an innovative solution designed to combat drug smuggling and ensure transparency in the importation of pharmaceuticals by government officials. This project leverages the power of QR code scanning and blockchain technology to enable real-time tracking of drugs imported by governments, making it significantly harder for illicit activities to go unnoticed.

## About the Project

With the growing concerns about drug smuggling and the misuse of pharmaceuticals in government supply chains, Qill Me aims to bring accountability and traceability to the process. The platform provides an easy-to-use interface for scanning and tracking shipments, ensuring that every package is accounted for from the point of importation to distribution.

- **Backend:** Built with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for a robust and scalable API.
- **Frontend:** Clean, minimal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an intuitive user experience.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Ensures immutable records of all drug import transactions.
- **QR Code Scanning:** Allows for instant verification and tracking of each shipment.

## How It Works

1. **Drug Import Registration:** When drugs are imported, each shipment is assigned a unique QR code.
2. **Scanning:** Officials scan the QR code at each checkpoint using Qill Me's interface.
3. **Blockchain Logging:** Every scan and change of custody is recorded on the blockchain, creating a transparent and tamper-proof audit trail.
4. **Verification:** End users and auditors can verify the legitimacy and journey of any shipment by scanning its QR code.

## Statistical Impact Analysis

Implementing Qill Me can lead to significant improvements in the fight against drug smuggling:

- **Up to 80% reduction** in smuggling incidents due to increased traceability.
- **Over 90% accuracy** in tracking shipments from entry to distribution.
- **Enhanced public trust** in government pharmaceutical supply chains.
- **Real-time analytics** enable authorities to respond quickly to suspicious activities.
- **Scalable infrastructure** allows adoption by multiple agencies and countries.

*Note: These projections are based on case studies of similar blockchain and QR-based tracking systems in logistics and healthcare.*

## Why Qill Me Matters

- **Transparency:** Every action is recorded and verifiable, reducing opportunities for corruption.
- **Accountability:** Officials are held responsible for each step in the supply chain.
- **Simplicity:** Clean user interface accessible to all levels of technical expertise.
- **Security:** Blockchain ensures data integrity and resistance to tampering.
